# Introduction-to-OpenCV-
This repository contains codes and files from introductory course I did on openCV. A basic implementation of face recognition library. 
used library like : dlib, cv2, face_recognition and their basic methods to implement a basic attendance tracking system. 
.. worked on virtual setup. faced problem installing dlib through conda but did it anyway :) 
command worked for me on conda command prompt was : 
>> conda install -c conda-forge dlib  
don't know how? ;) 
Apart from these, worked on TextToSpeech conversion using python library. literally perhaps python has all kind of precoded tasks we need haha..
